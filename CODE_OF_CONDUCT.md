# Contributor Code of Conduct

As contributors and maintainers of this project, we pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone. We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for participant behavior, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing this Code of Conduct. Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject content, and to suspend or ban participants who violate this Code of Conduct.

Maintainers will attempt to follow a fair and transparent process when handling reports and enforcement actions.

## Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please report it by:

- **For Code of Conduct violations**: Contact the Cloudinary team at [cld-dev-pub@cloudinary.com](mailto:cld-dev-pub@cloudinary.com).
- **For GitHub-specific issues**: Use [GitHub's reporting features](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/maintaining-your-safety-on-github/reporting-abuse-or-spam)
- **For technical issues or bugs**: Please refer to our [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines
- **Direct contact**: Reach out to repository maintainers through GitHub by mentioning @cloudinary/cloudinary-react-native-maintainers

When reporting, please include as much information as you can:

- What happened
- When and where it happened (specific PR, issue, discussion, or external venue)
- Any screenshots, logs, or messages that document the behavior
- The GitHub usernames or names of people involved
- Any relevant links to conversations or incidents

All reports will be treated with discretion and confidentiality. Reports will be reviewed by Cloudinary maintainers and may involve a designated neutral third party for serious violations.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

- **Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

- **Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

- **Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

- **Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

- **Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

- **Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

- **Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

- **Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by the Cloudinary React Native project, including:

- GitHub repository (issues, pull requests, discussions, code reviews)
- Cloudinary support forums and community channels
- Official Cloudinary events and meetups
- Social media when representing the project

It also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces. Examples include using an official Cloudinary email address, posting via official social media accounts, or acting as an appointed representative at online or offline events.

## Enforcement

When a violation is reported, the project team will review and investigate it and determine an appropriate response, which may include:

- A warning message
- Temporary or permanent removal of access to project resources (e.g., repositories, issue trackers, chat rooms)
- In severe or repeated cases, a public or private statement explaining the violation and the actions taken

Where applicable, we will strive to follow a transparent, timely, and fair process for handling reports.
