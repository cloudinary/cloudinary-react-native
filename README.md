## Version Support
| SDK Version | React Native Version |
|-------------|----------------------|
| 0.0.2       | > 0.6                | 

## Installation
### Install using your favorite package manager (yarn, npm)
```bash
npm install cloudinary-react-native

```
Or
```bash
yarn add cloudinary-react-native --save
```

## Usage
### Setup
The `Cloudinary` class is the main entry point for using the library. Your `cloud_name` is required to create an instance of this class. Your `api_key` and `api_secret` are also needed to perform secure API calls to Cloudinary (e.g., image and video uploads). Setting the configuration parameters can be done either programmatically using an appropriate constructor of the Cloudinary class or globally using an environment variable. You can find your account-specific configuration parameters in the **Dashboard** page of your [account console](https://cloudinary.com/console).

Here's an example of setting configuration parameters in your React Native application:

```js
import { AdvancedImage } from 'cloudinary-react-native';
import { Cloudinary } from '@cloudinary/url-gen';
```

### Transform and Optimize Assets
- [See full documentation](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/)

```tsx
import { AdvancedImage } from 'cloudinary-react-native';
import {Cloudinary} from '@cloudinary/url-gen';

const myCld = new Cloudinary({
  cloud: {
    cloudName: "demo",
  },
});

let img = myCld.image('sample');

export default function App() {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <AdvancedImage cldImg={createMyImage()} style={{width:300, height:200}}/>
    </View>
  );
};
```
